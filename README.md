Task 2: Django services and frontend - 60 minutes

The specification of this task is vague - as are most of the tasks in real life. ðŸ™‚ 
You will need to balance your time and imagination. If you are out of time, feel free to provide a very basic solution, but for bonus points, add any feature, UX or functional.

The task is simple: Create a small weather app in Django. 

The app can use the met.no service to acquire data via a GET call - on the server side: https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact?lat=51.5&lon=-0.25 - you need to pass the coordinates only. In the application you need to create a way to input the location and then use that information to display weather information. The whole UX is up to you. (Hint: you will only use a fraction of the data from this service!)

Please create a git repo and update it with your code - as it develops. Try to commit as frequently as possible - with meaningful comments - just as you would do in a real project. At the end of the task, please share the link to your repo.
